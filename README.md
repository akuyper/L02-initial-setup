## Overview

The goal of this lab is to revisit data splitting. This includes advanced techniques in data spending and transformations/balancing of the outcome variable.

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the questions provided in `LO2_initial_setup.html`. A template is provided (rename as lastname_firstname_L02.qmd).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which should contain a link to your github repo. Including the github repo link takes the place of having to submit the additional qmd and r files. See canvas for submission details.
